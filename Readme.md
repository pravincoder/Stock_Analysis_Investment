## Installation
###  Fast Installation (Via Docker)

#### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
### Steps to Run Using Docker
1. Clone the repository: See [Backend Setup Step 1 Command](#backend-setup) 
2. Setup Environments : See [Env Setup](#environment-variable-setup)
3. Change Directory to Stock_Analyzer:- 
 ```bash 
   cd Stock_investment_Analysis_Crew/Stock_Analyzer
  ```
4.Docker Build Both Frontend and Backend with Compose (Can even build Frontend and Backend Seperately using *docker build Dockerfile*)
```bash 
   docker-compose build
  ``` 


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- Conda 20+

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pravincoder/Stock_investment_Analysis_Agent.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Main directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stock_investment_Analysis_Agent/Stock_Analyzer
   ```
3. Create  a conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
4. Activate the Conda Environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate crew
   ```
5. Run the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd nextjs_app
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest --js --tailwind --eslint
   ```
   Keep every option default while setting up the app.
3. Run the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
Note:- You need to execute both the backend Flask app and the Frontend as we are using cross connection with flask-cors.

## Environment Variable Setup
### `.env` File Setup 
Create  a .env file and add the below code :- (Make sure to add the api keys from the specified platforms)
#### *Note:- Use .sample.env by renaming as .env and add your Keys.* 
```dotenv
# API Key for GROQ
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# API Key for OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Base URL for OpenAI API (default for local setup)
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1

# Model name for OpenAI (adjust based on available models)
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=mistral:latest

# Optional: API Key for LangChain
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key_here

# Optional: Enable LangChain tracing
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```

### (Optional) Using Local LLM with Ollama
- Use the  files in the setup folder to create a LLama3 , Mistral8b ... or your own LLM model
